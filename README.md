## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - Frontend build tool
- [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) - Country data source
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework

### What I learned

This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of **Next.js**, particularly its file-based routing system, page structure, and the benefits of using a framework optimized for performance and scalability.

By working with the **REST Countries API**, I gained hands-on experience consuming external APIs, handling asynchronous data fetching, and transforming complex JSON responses into clean, user-friendly UI components.

I also reinforced my knowledge of **React**, focusing on component composition, state management, and rendering dynamic lists based on API data.

Finally, I continued to strengthen my use of **Tailwind CSS**, applying a mobile-first approach and building responsive layouts efficiently using utility-first classes.
